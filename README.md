# About
This repository provides a keymap for the Lenovo KU-1255 (ThinkPad Compact USB Keyboard with TrackPoint) firmware. The firmware stores key-specific values, generated by XORing the HID Usage ID with 0x5A, at specific offsets within the binary. By modifying these XORed IDs, you can remap any key on the KU-1255. A GUI tool to easily create a key-remapped firmware is also provided.

# Disclaimer
The data in this table is generated from automated firmware analysis using `keymap_offset_finder.py`. **The result accuracy is not assured. Use at your own risk.**

# GUI Tool Usage
1. Download the latest firmware `tp_compact_usb_kb_with_trackpoint_fw.exe` from the [Lenovo official website](https://support.lenovo.com/ca/en/solutions/pd026745).
2. Download the [released application](https://github.com/haborite/ku1255-firmware-keymap/releases/download/v0.4.1/ku1255-fw-remapper-win-0.4.1.zip) and unzip it.
3. Run `ku1255-fw-remapper.exe` in the unzipped directory (It will take a bit time to launch).

5. Click "1. Select Original Firmware" and select the downloaded firmware `tp_compact_usb_kb_with_trackpoint_fw.exe`.
6. Confirm that the original SHA256 hash is `7116a3819ee094857d21e4671cb6cf953d582372126f0f6728f6b2421eda7bd4`.
7. Click "2. Select Key Remap csv" and select a key-remap csv file (e.g. Use `examples\Swap-Fn-Ctrl.csv` to just swap `Fn` and `LeftControl`). If you want to create or modify key-remapping csv files, please see the "Offset & XORed ID table" described below.  
5. Click "3. Modify and Save New Firmware", and specify the filename and path of the new firmware.
6. Check SH256 hash (e.g. If you use `Swap-Fn-Ctrl.csv`, it should be `123143092dab578550c87a62526b07a6c5f06c047f2455be87971aa51577e300`).
7. Close the app.
