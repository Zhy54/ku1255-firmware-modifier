# KU-1255 Firmware Modifier

A simple GUI tool for customizing the firmware of the **[Lenovo ThinkPad Compact USB Keyboard with TrackPoint](https://support.lenovo.com/jp/ja/solutions/pd026745-thinkpad-compact-usb-keyboard-with-trackpoint-overview-and-service-parts)** (US model: **0B47190**).  
You can remap any key on the keyboard‚Äîfor example, reassign the `Ctrl` key to the `Fn` key position in the bottom-left corner.

Because changes are written directly to the keyboard's firmware, **no system-side configuration is required**. The layout remains consistent across all connected devices and operating systems.

## ‚úÖ System Requirements

- Since the app use the official firmware installer, your system must meet the [software requirements listed here](https://support.lenovo.com/jp/ja/solutions/pd026745-thinkpad-compact-usb-keyboard-with-trackpoint-overview-and-service-parts).
  - Once the firmware is installed, the keyboard works on **most operating systems**, regardless of the one used during installation.
- Internet connection is required at the first run of the app to download the official firmware installer from Lenovo web page.

## üñ•Ô∏è Interface Overview

1. **Keyboard Selection**  
   Choose your keyboard model. For US layout, select:  
   `0B47190 (84 keys - ANSI)`

2. **Language Selection**

3. **Main Layer**  
   Defines the default keymap. Click any key to change it, and select a key you want to newly map from the dropdown.

4. **2nd Layer**  
   Defines key behavior when used with the **Mod** key.  
   - This layer is disabled by default because the Mod key isn‚Äôt initially defined in the Main Layer.
   - The Mod key must be assigned in both Main and 2nd layers at the same position.

5. **Load config**  
   Load a previously saved keymap from a `.json` file.

6. **Save config**  
   Save the current keymap to a `.json` file.
